### Final goal : Build a tumor detector by [2026]
#### Resources: 
1. [Coursera ] [ Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)   
## Day 1 Update  
- Learned about [intro ,how neural networks work ].  

## Day 2 Update  
- Learned about [logistic regression].  

```
Y = 1 / ( 1 + e^-z) 
```


## Day 3 update
- Learned about [ Gradient descending]
```
Repeat {
    w := w - alpha (d J(w,b)) / dw
    b := b - alpha (d J(w,b)) / db
       }
```
## Day 4 update
- Learned about [ computational graph]
